# Hi, I’m Alex Lee 👋

I'm a dedicated student with a passion for artificial intelligence and deep learning, currently focused on demystifying the inner workings of large language models (LLMs).

## 👨‍💻 About Me

- 🎓 **Student** specializing in AI, NLP, and deep learning.
- 🚀 **Current Project**: Crafting a custom LLM from scratch to truly understand every component—from tokenization to inference.

## 🛠️ Skills

- **Languages:** Python (primary), familiar with C++
- **Frameworks:** PyTorch, NumPy
- **Interests:** LLMs, neural architectures, transformers

## 🌱 What I’m Learning

- Deep dives into transformer architectures and attention mechanisms
- Optimizing training and inference for large models

## 📂 Featured Project

### 🧠 Custom LLM From Scratch (Arcane)
> Building, training, and evaluating a large language model with PyTorch to uncover the “how” and “why” behind state-of-the-art AI.
